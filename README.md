A set of crypto libraries for Swift, written in Swift.
 
## MD5
 
PBKDF2 is a library that provides PBKDF2 key derivation support on top of CryptoEssentials using your preferred hashing function with HMAC.

## Usage

```swift
var passwordBytes = [UInt8]("hunter2".utf8), salt = [UInt8]("r4nd0ms4lT!".utf8)

let sha1hash = try PBKDF2<SHA1>.calculate(passwordBytes, salt: salt, iterations: 10000)

// You can use other algorithms too, and strings for passwords
let sha256hash = try PBKDF2<SHA2<SHA256>>.calculate("mypassword", salt: salt, iterations: 10000)

// Plus you can specify the return key size
// Also.. please don't use PBKDF2 with MD5 for password hashing..
let sha1hash = try PBKDF2<MD5>.calculate(passwordBytes, salt: salt, iterations: 10000, keySize: 128)

print(sha256hash.hexString)
```
